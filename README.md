# Collected Speeches of Dr. William B. McLean

Several years ago I was working as a contractor at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California and discovered this collection of speeches in the gift shop. It has since been [published as a scanned PDF of the original on the Defense Technical Information Center][1], but no fully digital version is available anywhere. This repository is a work in progress to digitize these texts.

Dr. McLean was a visionary inventor and manager, and these speeches represent management techniques that should be applied to many, if not all, large Department of Defense government contracts. Unfortunately it seems that most of these techniques have been lost over time.
